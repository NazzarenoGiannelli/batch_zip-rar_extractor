# Batch .zip and .rar extractors

This couple of scripts allows you to **extract multiple zip or rar files into new folders that inherit the same name of the original zip/rar file**.
It saved me hours of work unzipping a large collection of compressed files.

Hopefully it will help many others too :slightly_smiling_face:

The scripts detect .zip or .rar files in the provided directory, so you don't have to worry about files of other formats present in the same folder.

## How To:
- Copy the directory you have your zip/rar files in.
- Launch **Batch Zip Extractor.bat** or **Batch Rar Extractor.bat** depending on the extension of the files you want to process.
- Paste the directory into the Power Shell window and press Enter.
- Enjoy seeing your files automatically extracted into folders that inherit the same name of the original compressed file.
- Repeat the operation into another folder or exit the program selecting the appropriate option.

For ease of use you can create links of the .bat files and keep them in some handy place on your hard drive instead of always look for the files' folder you can safely archive somewhere else instead.

## Requirements:
- 7zip installed (if you installed 7zip in a different location from the default one,
you need to uptade its directory in the .ps1 files code)
