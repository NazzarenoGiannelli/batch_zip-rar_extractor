# Batch .zip and .rar extractors

This couple of scripts allow you to extract multiple zip or rar files
into new folders that inherit the same name of the original zip/rar file.

## How To:
- Copy the directory you have your zip/rar files in.
- Launch **Batch Zip Extractor.bat** or **Batch Rar Extractor.bat** depending on the extension of the files you want to process.
- Paste the directory into the Power Shell window and press Enter.
- Enjoy seeing your files automatically extracted into folders that inherit the same name of the original compressed file.

## Requirements:
-7zip installed (if you installed 7zip in a different location from the default one,
you need to uptade its directory in the .ps1 files code)
