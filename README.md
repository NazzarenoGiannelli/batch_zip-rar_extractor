# Batch Zip/Rar Extractor

This script allows you to **extract multiple zip files, rar files, or both, into new folders that inherit the same name of the original zip/rar file**.
It saved me hours of work unzipping a large collection of compressed files.

Hopefully it will help many others too :slightly_smiling_face:

The script detects .zip and .rar files in the provided directory, so you don't have to worry about files of other formats present in the same folder.

## How To:
- Copy the directory you have your zip/rar files in.
- Launch **Run Batch_Zip-Rar_Extractor.bat**.
- Paste the directory into the Power Shell window and press Enter.
- Select which file format you wanna process.
- Enjoy seeing your files automatically extracted into folders that inherit the same name of the original compressed file.
- Repeat the operation or exit the program selecting the appropriate option.

For ease of use you can create a link of the .bat file and keep it in some handy place on your hard drive instead of always look for the files' folder you can safely archive somewhere else instead.

## Requirements:
- 7zip installed (if you installed 7zip in a different location from the default one,
you need to uptade its directory in the .ps1 files code)
